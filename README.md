# AKLT_Boundary_Theory
Codes used to study the boundary theory of the 2D square lattice AKLT model: https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10327 <br />

* AKLT_Square_SpinSpinCorrelationFunctions.py computes the spin-spin correlation functions of the boundary state. <br />
* AKLT_Square_SpinSpinCorrelationFunction_N_y_sweep.py computes the spin-spin correlation functions of spins on opposite sides of a full cylinder for various N_y. <br />
* AKLT_Square_LoopProperties_LoopWeightSweep.py computes the average loop size and average loop number, sweeping over the weight of closed loops and the weight of degree 2 vertices. <br />
* AKLT_Square_LoopProperties_VertexWeightSweep.py computes the average loop size and average loop number, sweeping over the weight of degree 2 and degree 4 vertices. <br />
* AKLT_Square_BoundaryHamiltonianAndProperties.py computes the boundary Hamiltonian and some of its properties (Heisenberg amplitude and interaction size). <br />
